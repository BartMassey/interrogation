When play begins: say "You sit in a chair, bound, under the merciless glare of a bare bulb. A table squats before you. The silence is maleficent and all-pervasive."

The Interrogation Room is a room. "A bare, chill concrete room."

The metal chair is enterable and fixed in place. It is in the Interrogation Room. The description is "A cold, hard chair in a cold, hard place."

The table is fixed in place in the Interrogation Room. The description is "An ugly metal table, bracketed to the floor."

The player is in the metal chair. The description of the player is "You are cold, tired, and dispirited. You wonder what will happen next."

Instead of exiting when the player is in the metal chair: say "You seem to be bound in place."
